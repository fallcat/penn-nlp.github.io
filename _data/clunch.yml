  title: "Fighting COVID-19 using Parsing Algorithms and Grammar Formalisms"
  abstract: |
    To defeat the current COVID-19 pandemic, a messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine has emerged as a promising approach thanks to its rapid and scalable production and non-infectious and non-integrating properties. However, designing an mRNA sequence to achieve high stability and protein yield remains a challenging problem due to the exponentially large search space (e.g., there are 2.4 x 10^632 possible mRNA sequence candidates for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2). We describe two on-going efforts for this problem, both using linear-time algorithms inspired by my earlier work in natural language parsing. On one hand, the Eterna OpenVaccine project from Stanford Medical School takes a crowd-sourcing approach to let game players all over the world design stable sequences. To evaluate sequence stability (in terms of free energy), they use LinearFold from my group (2019) since itâ€™s the only linear-time RNA folding algorithm available (which makes it the only one fast enough for COVID-scale genomes). On the other hand, we take a computational approach to directly search for the optimal sequence in this exponentially large space via dynamic programming. It turns out this problem can be reduced to a classical problem in formal language theory and computational linguistics (intersection between CFG and DFA), which can be solved in O(n^3) time, just like lattice parsing for speech. In the end, we can design the optimal mRNA vaccine candidate for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in just about 10 minutes.

    This talk is dedicated to the memory of my PhD advisor Aravind Joshi who taught me that linguistics and biology share the same mathematical foundations.

  title: "Dungeons and Discourse: Using Computational Storytelling & Speech to Look at Natural Language Use"
  abstract: "Although we are currently riding a technological wave of personal assistants, many of these agents still struggle to communicate appropriately. In particular, these systems lack coherence, the ability to adapt to novel situations, creativity, emotional understanding, and collaboration. My work focuses on creating open-world storytelling systems and developing agents that leverage speech understanding to communicate with humans more effectively. In this talk, I look at how tabletop roleplaying games such as Dungeons & Dragons can be used as motivation for how to improve conversational systems and understand how people communicate."

  title: Statistical Significance Testing for Natural Language Processing
  abstract: |
    Data-driven experimental analysis has become the main evaluation tool of Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms. In fact, in the last decade, it has become rare to see an NLP paper, particularly one that proposes a new algorithm, that does not include extensive experimental analysis, and the number of involved tasks, datasets, domains, and languages is constantly growing. This emphasis on empirical results highlights the role of statistical significance testing in NLP research: If we, as a community, rely on empirical evaluation to validate our hypotheses and reveal the correct language processing mechanisms, we better be sure that our results are not coincidental.

    In this talk, I will go through the main chapters of the book in the title (https://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/abs/10.2200/S00994ED1V01Y202002HLT045) and answer the following questions: How to choose a valid statistical test for your experiments? How to perform statistical analysis when experimenting with multiple datasets? How to compare deep neural models in a statistically valid manner? And some more surprises...

  title: "Closing the Loop in Natural Language Interfaces to Relational Databases: Parsing, Dialogue, and Generation"
  abstract: |
    Natural Language is a very efficient method of communication among humans. However, when users want to talk to their computers, translating this NL to computer actions is a very challenging task. One possible way for such human-computer interaction is to translate NL sentences to database queries and then to convert the output of these queries back to NL. In order for such an approach to work, one needs to address several challenges: the lack of annotated question-query pairs, the discourse issues present in multi-turn questions, and the issues that arise in a dialogue context.

    In this presentation, I will talk about recent work on natural language interfaces to databases. As part of the Yale Spider project, we have developed three new datasets and launched three matching shared tasks. Spider is a collection of 10,181 manually created natural language questions on databases from 138 domains, and the 5,693 database queries that correspond to them. SParC (Semantic Parsing in Context) consists of 4,298 coherent sequences of questions and the matching queries. Finally, CoSQL consists of WoZ 3k dialogues and a total of 30k turns, and their translations to SQL.

    I will then introduce GraPPa, a pre-training approach for table semantic parsing that learns a compositional inductive bias in the joint representations of textual and tabular data. We used GraPPa to obtain SOTA performance on four popular fully supervised and weakly supervised table semantic parsing benchmarks.

    Joint work with Tao Yu, Rui Zhang, Victoria Lin, Caiming Xiong, and many others.

  title: "You can lead a horse to water...: Representing vs. Using Features in Neural NLP"
  abstract: "A wave of recent work has sought to understand how pretrained language models work. Such analyses have resulted in two seemingly contradictory sets of results. On one hand, work based on \"probing classifiers\" generally suggests that SOTA language models contain rich information about linguistic structure (e.g., parts of speech, syntax, semantic roles). On the other hand, work which measures performance on linguistic \"challenge sets\" shows that models consistently fail to use this information when making predictions. In this talk, I will present a series of results that attempt to bridge this gap. Our recent experiments suggest that the disconnect is not due to catastrophic forgetting nor is it (entirely) explained by insufficient training data. Rather, it is best explained in terms of how \"accessible\" features are to the model following pretraining, where \"accessibility\" can be quantified using an information-theoretic interpretation of probing classifiers."

  title: "Where Neural Networks Fail: The Case for a Little Help from Knowledge"
  abstract: "Today's dominant paradigm for modeling complex linguistic tasks calls for training neural networks by minimizing loss on massive datasets.  While the agenda is undeniably successful, we may not have the luxury of annotated data for every task or domain of interest.  Reducing dependence on labeled examples may require us to rethink how we supervise models. In this talk, I will discuss some failures of today's end-to-end trained neural networks. In particular, I will focus on two phenomena---societal stereotypes implicitly present in their decisions, and their inability to perform complex reasoning---both due to the models inability to internalize knowledge about the world. Following this, I will describe our work on using knowledge to inform neural networks without introducing additional parameters. Declarative rules stated in logic can be systematically compiled into computation graphs that augment the structure of neural models, and also into regularizers that can use labeled or unlabeled examples.  I will present experiments involving text understanding and semantic role labeling, which show that such declaratively constrained neural networks can successfully internalize the information in the rules, providing an easy-to-use mechanism for supervising neural networks that does not involve data annotation."

  title: "Simultaneous Translation: Breakthrough and Recent Progress"
  abstract: "Simultaneous interpretation (i.e., translating concurrently with the source language speech) is widely used in many scenarios including multilateral organizations (UN/EU), international summits (APEC/G-20), legal proceedings, and press conferences. However, it is well known to be one of the most challenging tasks for humans due to the simultaneous perception and production in two languages. As a result, there are only a few thousand professional simultaneous interpreters world-wide, and each of them can only sustain for 15-30 minutes in each turn. On the other hand, simultaneous translation (either speech-to-text or speech-to-speech) is also notoriously difficult for machines and has remained one of the holy grails of AI. A key challenge here is the word order difference between the source and target languages. For example, if you simultaneously translate German (an SOV language) to English (an SVO language), you often have to wait for the sentence-final German verb. Therefore, most existing \"real-time\" translation systems resort to conventional full-sentence translation, causing an undesirable latency of at least one sentence, rendering the audience largely out of sync with the speaker. There have been efforts towards genuine simultaneous translation, but with limited success. Recently, we discovered a much simpler and surprisingly effective approach to simultaneous (speech-to-text) translation by designing a \"prefix-to-prefix\" framework tailed to simultaneity requirements. This is in contrast with the \"sequence-to-sequence\" framework which assumes the availability of the full input sentence. Our approach results in the first simultaneous translation system that achieves reasonable translation quality with controllable latency and was successfully deployed in many commercial products. Since 2019, our work has attracted renewed interest in this long-standing problem which was once thought to be out of reach. I will also discuss our efforts towards the ultimate goal of simultaneous speech-to-speech translation, and conclude with a list of remaining challenges. (Part of this talk was given as an ACL 2019 Keynote, but this Clunch talk will cover more recent progress.)"

  title: Building Robust Conversational Question Answering Systems Over Databases of Tabular Data
  abstract: A vast amount of information is stored in relational databases consisting of tables. These databases provide fundamental frameworks of data systems for business in various domains. In real-world applications, users would like to interact with databases for information requests just like talking to a human. However, querying databases requires proficiency in the SQL query language syntax and the knowledge of underlying table structures. Consequently, despite the enormous popularity of relational databases, the ability to retrieve information from these databases is still limited for many ordinary users. In this talk, I will describe some completed and ongoing efforts to build conversational question answering systems over databases of tabular data that is (1) robust to user queries by handling different types of user inputs, (2) conversational and interactive by conversing with users in a dialog setting with its reasoning ability over multi-turn contexts of interaction history, (3) explainable and verifiable by generating natural language explanations of system predicted SQL queries and execution results for user verification and feedback, (4) transferable and adaptable by quickly adapting to different domains and scenarios of databases.

  title: Ongoing Work on Summarization Evaluation Metrics
  abstract: In this talk, I will provide an overview of two ongoing works on summarization evaluation metrics. The first work analyzes the extent to which ROUGE and BERTScore actually measure the information overlap between two summaries. I show that they largely do not and propose an alternative method of comparing summarization systems which does and is interpretable. The second work focuses on using QA to evaluate summaries. After proposing a new QA-based metric, I benchmark its performance on current datasets, identify performance bottlenecks, and estimate its upper-bound performance, concluding QA is a promising future research direction.

  title: Modelling Language and the World
  abstract: Much recent progress in NLP has been driven by training language models on large unlabelled datasets. I will argue that language modelling requires both linguistic and world knowledge, but that these can be disentangled and modelled separately. First, I will describe kNN-LM, which shows how converting a language model into a nearest neighbor classifier can give large gains in performance, by giving the model access to facts in the training set during inference. I will then introduce MARGE, a new approach to pre-training sequence-to-sequence models with an unsupervised paraphrasing objective. This objective emphasises learning to paraphrase over memorizing facts. MARGE performs well on classification, generation and retrieval tasks in many languages, without supervision in some cases, making it arguably the most broadly applicable pre-trained model to date.

  title: The Polarization and Nationalization of American State Party Platforms, 1918-2017
  abstract: The role of U.S. state political parties has changed substantially in recent decades. One common supposition is that contemporary state parties are increasingly polarized and nationalized, meaning that the Democratic and Republican parties adopt similar positions nationwide. Yet, the relationship between these shifts, the mechanisms underpinning them, and the extent to which they have unfolded similarly across states and issue areas remain open questions. We introduce a data set of 2,041 state party platforms to measure nationalization and polarization between 1918 and 2018. Applying tools from automated and manual content analysis, we find that there is a dramatic divergence in the topics covered in Democratic and Republican platforms starting in the early 1990s, at virtually the same time as federal-level rhetorical polarization. During this same period, the differences across states in platforms decreased and social issues became more prominent, suggesting a tight connection between polarization, nationalization, and social issues such as abortion.

  title: Towards interactive story generation
  abstract: "Story generation is difficult to computationally formalize and evaluate, and there are many important questions to ask when tackling the problem. What should we consider as the base unit of a story (e.g., a sentence? a paragraph? a chapter?) What kind of data should we use to train these models (novels? short stories? overly simplistic mechanically-turked paragraphs?) Is any model architecture currently capable of producing long-form narratives that have some semblance of coherent discourse structure, such as plot arcs and character development? When evaluating the outputs of our models, can we do better than just asking people to rate the text based on vaguely defined properties such as \"enjoyability\"? In this talk, I'll discuss my lab's ongoing work on story generation by introducing a new dataset and evaluation method that we hope will spur progress in this area. I'll then describe practical challenges (slow inference, unsecure models) that we face when deploying our models in real-world author-facing settings, along with some solutions we have developed to combat these challenges."

  title: NLP Evaluations That We Believe In
  abstract: "With all of the modeling advancements in recent years, NLP benchmarks have been falling over left and right: \"human performance\" has been reached on SQuAD 1 and 2, GLUE and SuperGLUE, and many commonsense datasets.  Yet no serious researcher actually believes that these systems understand language, or even really solve the underlying tasks behind these datasets.  To get benchmarks that we actually believe in, we need to both think more deeply about the language phenomena that our benchmarks are targeting, and make our evaluation sets more rigorous.  I will first present ORB, an Open Reading Benchmark that collects many reading comprehension datasets that we (and others) have recently built, targeting various aspects of what it means to read.  I will then present contrast sets, a way of creating non-iid test sets that more thoroughly evaluate a model's abilities on some task, decoupling training data artifacts from test labels."

  title: Cross-Lingual Transfer of Natural Language Processing Systems
  abstract: "Accurate natural language processing systems rely heavily on annotated datasets. In the absence of such datasets, transfer methods can help to develop a model by transferring annotations from one or more rich-resource languages to the target language of interest. These methods are generally divided into two approaches: 1) annotation projection from translation data, aka parallel data, using supervised models in rich-resource languages, and 2) direct model transfer from annotated datasets in rich-resource languages. In this talk, we present different methods for transfer of syntactic and semantic dependency parsers. We propose an annotation projection method that performs well in scenarios for which a large amount of in-domain parallel data is available. We also propose a method which is a combination of annotation projection and direct model transfer that can leverage a minimal amount of information from a small out-of-domain parallel dataset to develop highly accurate transfer models. Furthermore, we present an unsupervised syntactic reordering model to improve the accuracy of dependency parser transfer for non-European languages. We also propose a method for cross-lingual transfer of dependency parsing based on multi-task learning by leveraging supervised syntactic information in the target language of interest. Finally, we introduce our current efforts for learning cross-lingual representations using information from different modalities especially from images in the massively multilingual image dataset (MMID)."

  title: Connecting the Dots between Learning Paradigms
  abstract: Continued research has created a diverse set of learning algorithms for ingesting distinct forms of experience (e.g. data, cost, knowledge constraints). However, it is often challenging for practitioners to choose or adapt solutions from such a bewildering marketplace of algorithms, as it could demand deep ML expertise and bespoke innovations. This talk will present an attempt to systematize several paradigms of algorithms for both a unifying understanding and new systematic methodologies of creating ML solutions. I will show that some of the popular algorithms in supervised learning, constraint-driven learning, reinforcement learning, etc, indeed share a common succinct formulation, showing that different forms of experience can be used for learning in the same way. The unifying representation of algorithms allows us to methodically exchange solutions between paradigms, and learn from combinations of experience jointly, for complex problems such as text and image generation.

  title: Neural Module Networks for Reasoning over Text
  abstract: Answering compositional questions that require multiple steps of reasoning against text is challenging, especially when they involve discrete, symbolic operations. Neural module networks (NMNs) learn to parse such questions as executable programs composed of learnable modules, performing well on synthetic visual QA domains. In this talk, I will outline the challenges in learning these models for non-synthetic questions on open-domain text, where a model needs to deal with the diversity of natural language and perform a broader range of reasoning. Then, I will present how we extend NMNs by (a) introducing modules that reason over a paragraph of text, performing symbolic reasoning (such as arithmetic, sorting, counting) over numbers and dates in a probabilistic and differentiable manner; and (b) proposing an unsupervised auxiliary loss to help extract arguments associated with the events in text. Additionally, we show that a limited amount of heuristically-obtained question program and intermediate module output supervision provides sufficient inductive bias for accurate learning. In conclusion, I will present methods for achieving interpretability in such compositional neural models and challenges for future research.

  title: Project Debater â€“ How Persuasive can a Computer be?
  abstract: Project Debater is the first AI system that can meaningfully debate a human opponent. The system, an IBM Grand Challenge, is designed to build coherent, convincing speeches on its own, as well as provide rebuttals to the opponentâ€™s main arguments. In 2019, Project Debater competed against Harish Natarajan, who holds the world record for most debate victories, in an event held in San Francisco that was broadcasted live world-wide. In this talk I will tell the story of Project Debater, from conception to a climatic final event, describe its underlying technology, and discuss how it can be leveraged for advancing decision making and critical thinking.

  title: Injecting output constraints into neural NLP models in a model agnostic way
  abstract: |+
    The talk discusses a particular method of injecting constraints into neural models, primarily for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. While neural models have set the new state of the art performance in many tasks from vision to NLP, they often fail to learn simple rules necessary for well-formed structures unless there is an immense amount of training data. The talk claims that not all the aspects of the model have to be learned from the data itself and injecting simple knowledge/constraints into the neural models can help low-resource tasks as well as improving state-of-the-art models.

    The talk focuses on the structural knowledge of the output space and injects knowledge of correct or preferred structures as an objective to the model in a model-agnostic way, i.e. without modification to the model structure. The first benefit of focusing on the knowledge of output space is that it is intuitive as we can directly enforce outputs to satisfy logical/linguistic constraints. Another advantage of structural knowledge is that it often does not require a labeled dataset.

    Focusing on the example of Semantic Role Labeling and its constraints related to the syntactic parse tree, the talk showcases the efficacy of the proposed inference algorithm and the proposed semi-supervised learning.

  title: Lean Computer-Generated Poetry as Exploration of Language, Culture, and Computation
  abstract: "Computational poetics is a compelling area of NLP. Poetry has helped to constitute cultures for millennia and its composition is considered one of the most human activities. On the generation side, computational poetics involves the production of poetic language, potentially with meter, rhyme and other forms of musicality, metaphors and their cousins, narrative aspects, and intertextual references. Essentially, the main objective of computationally generated poetry is being culturally and individually resonant for at least some readers or listeners in some cultures. There are a wide variety of approaches, some of which seek to model human creativity, as in the computational creativity community. Work in the area is undertaken by academic researchers, poets and artists, and programmers seeking amusement and diversion during events such as NaNoGenMo (National Novel Generation Month), which accommodates the generation of all sorts of large-scale literature, including poetry. In my talk, I will introduce my own practice as a computational poet, which does not involve developing general models of human creativity. My practice is often considered experimental and sometimes conceptual; it is not, in any case, expressive, that is, mainly concerned with my experiences or with conveying my emotions. Rather, I consider myself a situated and embodied explorer of language, culture, and computation. My means of exploration is the development of computational poetry. My practice involves writing programs that are usually small and simple, based on specific unusual lexicons and combinatorial techniques. As part of inquiring about computation, my work connects with platform studies and deals with specifics of particular computers and programming languages. As I share and discuss some of my specific computational poems, I will describe how this type of NLG work touches on questions of language and thought as studied in, for instance, linguistics, cognitive science, and conventional poetics."

  title: "Sentence-level Semantic Inference: From Diverse Phenomena to Applications"
  abstract: Many NLP tasks involve understanding meaning at the sentence-level. In order to analyze such models, we should decompose sentence-level semantic understanding into a diverse array of smaller, more-focused, fine-grained types of reasoning. This will help improve our understanding of the sentence-level reasoning capabilities of our NLP systems. In this talk, we will focus on Natural Language Inference (NLI), the task of determining if one sentence (hypothesis) can likely be inferred from another (context/premise). NLI has traditionally be used to evaluate how well different models understand language and the relationship between texts. We investigate whether 10 recent NLI datasets require models to reason about both texts, or if the datasets contain biases or statistical irregularities that allow a model to correctly label a context-hypothesis pair by only looking at a hypothesis. In the most popular dataset that we consider, a hypothesis-only model outperforms the majority baseline by over 2x. We will also discuss our recently released dataset, the Diverse NLI Collection (DNC), that can be used to shed light on a modelâ€™s ability to capture or understand a diverse array of semantic phenomena that are important to Natural Language Understanding. We will demonstrate how a variant of the DNC has been used to evaluate whether a Neural Machine Translation encoder captures semantic phenomena related to translation. With the remaining time, we will discuss how lessons from these studies can be applied real-world uses cases of sentence-level semantic inference. This talk is based on work that has appeared at NAACL, ACL, StarSem, and EMNLP.

  title: Robot Control and Collaboration in Situated Instruction Following
  abstract: I will present two projects studying the problem of learning to follow natural language instructions. I will present new datasets, a class of interpretable models for instruction following, learning methods that combine the benefits of supervised and reinforcement learning, and new evaluation protocols. In the first part, I will discuss the task of executing natural language instructions with a robotic agent. In contrast to existing work, we do not engineer formal representations of language meaning or the robot environment. Instead, we learn to directly map raw observations and language to low-level continuous control of a quadcopter drone. In the second part, I will propose the task of learning to follow sequences of instructions in a collaborative scenario, where both the user and the system execute actions in the environment and the user controls the system using natural language. To study this problem, we build CerealBar, a multi-player 3D game where a leader instructs a follower, and both act in the environment together to accomplish complex goals. The two projects were led by Valts Blukis, Alane Suhr, and collaborators.

  title: Distributed Semantic Representations from Question-Answering Signals
  abstract: Human annotations, especially those from experts, are costly for many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. One emerging approach is to use natural language to annotate natural language, but it is challenging to get supervision effectively from annotations that are very different from the target task. This paper studies the case where the annotations are in the format of question answering (QA). We propose a novel approach to retrieve two types of semantic representations from QA, using which we can consistently improve on a suite of tasks. This work may have pointed out an alternative way to supervise NLP tasks.

  title: Revisiting post-processing for word embeddings
  abstract: Word embeddings learnt from large corpora have been adopted in various applications in natural language processing and served as the general input representations to learning systems. Recently, a series of post-processing methods have been proposed to boost the performance of word embeddings on similarity comparison and analogy retrieval tasks, and some have been adapted to compose sentence representations. The general hypothesis behind these methods is that by enforcing the embedding space to be more isotropic, the similarity between words can be better expressed. We view these methods as an approach to shrink the covariance/gram matrix, which is estimated by learning word vectors, towards a scaled identity matrix. By optimising an objective in the semi-Riemannian manifold with Centralised Kernel Alignment (CKA), we are able to search for the optimal shrinkage parameter, and provide a post-processing method to smooth the spectrum of learnt word vectors which yields improved performance on downstream tasks.

  title: A General-Purpose Algorithm for Constrained Sequential Inference
  abstract: Inference in structured prediction involves finding the best output structure for an input, subject to certain constraints. Many current approaches use sequential inference, which constructs the output in a left-to-right manner. However, there is no general framework to specify constraints in these approaches. We present a principled approach for incorporating constraints into sequential inference algorithms. Our approach expresses constraints using an automaton, which is traversed in lock-step during inference, guiding the search to valid outputs. We show that automata can express commonly used constraints and are easily incorporated into sequential inference. When it is more natural to represent constraints as a set of automata, our algorithm uses an active set method for demonstrably fast and efficient inference. We experimentally show the benefits of our algorithm on constituency parsing and semantic role labeling. For parsing, unlike unconstrained approaches, our algorithm always generates valid output, incurring only a small drop in performance. For semantic role labeling, imposing constraints using our algorithm corrects common errors, improving F1 by 1.5 points. These benefits increase in low-resource settings. Our active set method achieves a 5.2x relative speed-up over a naive approach.

  title: "Summary Cloze: A New Task for Content Selection in Topic-Focused Summarization"
  abstract: A key challenge in topic-focused summarization is determining what information should be included in the summary, a problem known as content selection. In this work, we propose a new method for studying content selection in topic-focused summarization called the summary cloze task. The goal of the summary cloze task is to generate the next sentence of a summary conditioned on the beginning of the summary, a topic, and a reference document(s). The main challenge is deciding what information in the references is relevant to the topic and partial summary and should be included in the summary. Although the cloze task does not address all aspects of the traditional summarization problem, the more narrow scope of the task allows us to collect a large-scale datset of nearly 500k summary cloze instances from Wikipedia. We report experimental results on this new dataset using various extractive models and a two-step abstractive model that first extractively selects a small number of sentences and then abstractively summarizes them. Our results show that the topic and partial summary help the models identify relevant content, but the task remains a significant challenge.

  title: "\"Going on a vacation\" takes longer than \"Going for a walk\": A Study of Temporal Commonsense Understanding"
  abstract: Understanding time is crucial for understanding events expressed in natural language. Because people rarely say the obvious, it is often necessary to have commonsense knowledge about various temporal aspects of events, such as duration, frequency, and temporal order. However, this important problem has so far received limited attention. This paper systematically studies this temporal commonsense problem. Specifically, we define five classes of temporal commonsense, and use crowdsourcing to develop a new dataset, MCTACO, that serves as a test set for this task. We find that the best current methods used on MCTACO are still far behind human performance, by about 20%, and discuss several directions for improvement. We hope that the new dataset and our study here can foster more future research on this topic.

  title: Neural Networks for Morphological Generation in the Minimal-Resource Setting
  abstract: As languages other than English are moving more and more into the focus of natural language processing, accurate handling of morphology is increasing in importance. This talk presents neural network-based approaches to morphological generation, casting the problem as a character-based sequence-to-sequence task. First, we will generally discuss how to successfully train neural sequence-to-sequence models for this. Then, since many morphologically rich languages only have limited resources, the main part of the talk will focus on how to overcome the challenges that limited amounts of annotated training data pose to neural models. The approaches covered in this talk include multi-task learning, cross-lingual transfer learning, and meta-learning.

  title: Human information processing in complex networks
  abstract: Humans communicate using systems of interconnected stimuli or concepts -- from language and music to literature and science -- yet it remains unclear how, if at all, the structure of these networks supports the communication of information. Although information theory provides tools to quantify the information produced by a system, traditional metrics do not account for the inefficient and biased ways that humans process this information. Here we develop an analytical framework to study the information generated by a system as perceived by a human observer. We demonstrate experimentally that this perceived information depends critically on a system's network topology. Applying our framework to several real networks, we find that they communicate a large amount of information (having high entropy) and do so efficiently (maintaining low divergence from human expectations). Moreover, we show that such efficient communication arises in networks that are simultaneously heterogeneous, with high-degree hubs, and clustered, with tightly-connected modules -- the two defining features of hierarchical organization. Together, these results suggest that many real networks are constrained by the pressures of information transmission, and that these pressures select for specific structural features.

  title: Joint Models for Social, Behavioral and Textual Information
  abstract: Understanding natural language communication often requires context, such as the speakers' backgrounds and social conventions, however, when it comes to computationally modeling these interactions, we typically ignore their broader context and analyze the text in isolation. In this talk, I will review on-going work demonstrating the importance of holistically modeling behavioral, social and textual information. I will focus on several NLP problems, including political discourse analysis on Twitter, partisan news detection and open-domain debate stance prediction, and discuss how jointly modeling text and social behavior can help reduce the supervision effort and provide a better representation for language understanding tasks.

  title: Similarity Inference for Legal Texts
  abstract: Quantifying similarity between pairs of documents is a ubiquitous task. Both researchers and members of the public frequently use document-level pairwise similarity measures to describe or explore unfamiliar corpora, or to test hypotheses regarding diffusion of ideas between authors. High-level similarity measures are particularly useful when dealing with legal or political corpora, which often contain long, thematically diverse, and specialized language that is difficult for non-experts to interpret. Unfortunately, though similarity estimation is a well-studied problem in the context of short documents and document excerpts, less attention has been paid to the problem of similarity inference for long documents.

  title: Comparison of Diverse Decoding Methods from Conditional Language Models
  abstract: While conditional language models have greatly improved in their ability to output high-quality natural language, many NLP applications benefit from being able to generate a diverse set of candidate sequences. Diverse decoding strategies aim to, within a given-sized candidate list, cover as much of the space of high-quality outputs as possible, leading to improvements for tasks that re-rank and combine candidate outputs. Standard decoding methods, such as beam search, optimize for generating high likelihood sequences rather than diverse ones, though recent work has focused on increasing diversity in these methods. We conduct an extensive survey of decoding-time strategies for generating diverse outputs from conditional language models. We also show how diversity can be improved without sacrificing quality by over-sampling additional candidates, then filtering to the desired number.

  title: Detecting whether Text is Human- or Machine-Generated
  abstract: With the advent of generative models with a billion parameters or more, it is now possible to automatically generate vast amounts of human-sounding text. But just how human-like is this machine-generated text? Intuitively, shorter amounts of machine-generated text are harder to detect, but exactly how many words can a machine generate and still fool both humans and trained discriminators? We investigate how the choices of sampling strategy and text sequence length impact discriminability from human-written text, using both automatic detection methods and human judgement.
