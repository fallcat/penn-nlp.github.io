  title: Overclaiming in NLP Is a Serious Problem. Underclaiming May Be Worse.
  abstract: |
    In an effort to avoid reinforcing widespread hype about the capabilities of state-of-the-art language technology systems, researchers have developed practices in framing and citation that serve to deemphasize the field's successes, even at the cost of making misleadingly strong claims about the limits of our best systems. This is a problem, though, and it may be more serious than it looks: It limits our ability to mitigate short-term harms from NLP deployments and it limits our ability to prepare for the potentially-enormous impacts of more distant future systems. This paper urges researchers to be careful about these claims, and suggests some research directions that will make it easier to avoid or rebut them.
