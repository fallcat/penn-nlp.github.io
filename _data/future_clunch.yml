  title: Out-of-distribution generalization in NLP
  abstract: |
    Real-world NLP models must work well when the test distribution differs from the training distribution. While we have made great progress in natural language understanding thanks to large-scale pre-training, current models still take shortcuts and rely on spurious correlations in specific datasets. In this talk, I will discuss the role of pre-training and data in model robustness to distribution shifts. In particular, I will describe how pre-trained models avoid learning spurious correlations, when data augmentation helps and hurts, and how large language models can be leveraged to improve few-shot learning.
