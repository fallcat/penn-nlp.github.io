  title: Language Models Memorize their Training Data; Dataset Deduplication Helps
  abstract: |
    Large neural language models are capable of memorizing their training data. First, I will discuss why this memorization is bad and the subtleties involved in studying harmful memorization tendencies. Then, I will go over some early results on the circumstances under which GPT-Neo, a popular public language model, exhibits memorization. Finally, I will describe our recent paper on deduplicating training data and discuss how models trained on deduplicated data memorize less, are more efficient to train, and possibly generalize better. I will also examine the problem of train-test leakage in existing popular datasets.

  title: Overclaiming in NLP Is a Serious Problem. Underclaiming May Be Worse.
  abstract: |
    In an effort to avoid reinforcing widespread hype about the capabilities of state-of-the-art language technology systems, researchers have developed practices in framing and citation that serve to deemphasize the field's successes, even at the cost of making misleadingly strong claims about the limits of our best systems. This is a problem, though, and it may be more serious than it looks: It limits our ability to mitigate short-term harms from NLP deployments and it limits our ability to prepare for the potentially-enormous impacts of more distant future systems. This paper urges researchers to be careful about these claims, and suggests some research directions that will make it easier to avoid or rebut them.
