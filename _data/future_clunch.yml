  title: Systematic Reasoning and Explanation over Natural Language
  abstract: |
    Recent work has shown that transformers can be trained to reason *systematically* with natural language (NL) statements, answering questions with answers implied by a set of provided facts and rules, and even generating proofs for those conclusions. However, these systems required all the knowledge to be provided explicitly as input. In this talk, I will describe our current work on generalizing this to real NL problems, where the system produces faithful, entailment-based proofs for its answers, including materializing its own latent knowledge as needed for those proofs. The resulting reasoning-supported answers can then be inspected, debugged, and corrected by the user, offering new opportunities for interactive problem-solving dialogs, and taking a step towards "teachable systems" that can learn from such dialogs over time.

  title: On the importance of baselines: Communicative efficiency and the statistics of words in natural language
  abstract: |
    Is language designed for communicative and functional efficiency? G. K. Zipf (1949) famously argued that shorter words are more frequent because they are easier to use, thereby resulting in the statistical law that bears his name. Yet, G. A. Miller (1957) showed that even a monkey randomly typing at a keyboard, and intermittently striking the space bar, would generate “words” with similar statistical properties. Recent quantitative analyses of human language lexicons (Piantadosi et al., 2012) have revived Zipf's functionalist hypothesis. Ambiguous words tend to be short, frequent, and easy to articulate in language production. Such statistical findings are commonly interpreted as evidence for pressure for efficiency, as the context of language use often provides cues to overcome lexical ambiguity. In this talk, I update Miller's monkey thought experiment to incorporate empirically motivated phonological and semantic constraints on the creation of words. I claim that the appearance of communicative efficiency is a spandrel (in the sense of Gould & Lewontin, 1979), as lexicons formed without the context of language use or reference to communication or efficiency exhibit comparable statistical properties. Furthermore, the updated monkey model provides a good fit for the growth trajectory of English as recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary. Focusing on the history of English words since 1900, I show that lexicons resulting from the monkey model provide a better embodiment of communicative efficiency than the actual lexicon of English. I conclude by arguing that the kind of faulty logic underlying the study of communicative efficiency crops up quite commonly within NLP -- evaluation metrics, and appropriate baselines, need to be carefully considered before any claims (cognitive or otherwise) can safely be made on their basis.
